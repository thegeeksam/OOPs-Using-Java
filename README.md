"R19CS203 - OOPs Using JAVA" Course Example programs

Welcome to the OOPs-Using-Java repository, where you can learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Java with some hilarious examples and exercises. This repo is designed for beginners who want to have fun while learning to code with one of the world's most popular and versatile languages. Here are some of the topics covered in this repo:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstraction and encapsulation
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Exceptions and error handling
- Collections and generics

To get started, you must install Java on your computer and set up an IDE of your choice. You can find detailed instructions on how to do that in the Installation.md file. Then, you can clone or download this repo and open it in your IDE. You will find a src folder containing all the source code files for each topic and a test folder containing some unit tests to check your understanding. You can also run the main method in the Main.java file to see some examples in action.

Each source code file has comments explaining Java's concepts and syntax, as well as some jokes and puns to make you laugh. You can also modify the code and experiment with different scenarios to see how Java behaves. For example, you can try to create a subclass of Animal called Unicorn and see what happens when you call its methods. Or, you can catch a NullPointerException and print a funny message instead of crashing the program.

We hope you enjoy this repo and learn a lot from it. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on GitHub. 

Happy coding!
